# Aperture Gallery - Abandoned 2.0 Code
This version of Aperture is incomplete, and was written when the original version of Aperture was abandoned due to bugs, and a corrupted
keystore. Now since the old version of Aperture has been updated to work much better than its original version, and better than this 
version, this code is now abandoned and used as reference code. Anyone is free to use this, but remember that it does not work as well.
