Frequently Asked Questions about PROJECT: Evo

1 - Why did you use source code from OwnGalleryView?

  A: Even though I have the ablility to completly write Aperture myself, I do not have the time due to College. So using the
  code allowed me to have a quicker start on the new Aperture.
  
2 - Why did you stop updating the last one?

  A: The keystore I used was expired. So I can no longer upload to that page :(
  
3 - When will this version be released?
  
  A: It is out now as an ALPHA! But I hope to release it fully by December. 
  
4 - What is and isn't working?

  A: Basic photo viewing is working. Deleting photos, editing, viewing video, and the App Theme Engine is NOT working as of 8/1/2016.
  I just don't have as much time as I would like :/
